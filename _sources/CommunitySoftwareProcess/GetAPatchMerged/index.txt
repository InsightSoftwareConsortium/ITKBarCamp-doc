Get a Patch Merged
==================

Description
-----------
  In this section, we discuss how to get a patch merged into the ITK repository.

Introduction
------------

The Insight Toolkit is a project developed by the ITK Community and for the ITK
Community.  If a community member is willing and able to fix a bug or add a
feature to the toolkit, they are encouraged to do so.  With the Git/Gerrit
distributed version control and code review system, any community member can
perform 95% of the effort required to get an improvement merged into the toolkit.
The last 5% of the effort, a final review and merge, will be granted to
community members that have considerable experience in the contribution
mechanisms of the project.  In this session, we discuss strategies to make that
last 5% happen and see a patch merged into the *master* branch of the ITK
repository.
